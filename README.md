      - I've always loved engineering things for solving real life problems.<br> 
      - This project is a custom 3d-printable torpedo pool toy that I designed using CAD software. <br>
      - The torpedo is powered by the elasticity of a rubber band and can self-propel. <br>
      - By selling these, I raised over $400 dollars for my swim team.<br>
      - The video below is an introduction/advertisement for the toy including instructions on how to change the rubber bands:<br>
