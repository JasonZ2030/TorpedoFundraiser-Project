# Torpedo Fundraiser Project

## Overview

I've always loved engineering things for solving real life problems. This project is a custom 3D-printable torpedo pool toy that I designed using CAD software. The torpedo is powered by the elasticity of a rubber band and can self-propel underwater, making it an exciting and engaging pool toy.

## Project Success

By selling these torpedoes, I raised over **$400** for my swim team, demonstrating how engineering and entrepreneurship can come together to support community causes.

## Features

- **3D-Printable Design**: Custom CAD model optimized for 3D printing
- **Rubber Band Propulsion**: Self-propelling mechanism powered by elastic energy
- **Easy Maintenance**: Replaceable rubber bands for extended use
- **Pool-Safe**: Designed specifically for underwater use

## Demo Video

Watch the introduction and advertisement video, which includes instructions on how to change the rubber bands:

## How It Works

The torpedo uses the stored elastic energy from a wound rubber band to propel itself through the water. When released, the rubber band unwinds, spinning an internal mechanism that drives the torpedo forward.
