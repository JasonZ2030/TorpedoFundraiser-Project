# TorpedoFundraiser-Project
- I've always loved engineering things for solving real life problems. 
- This project is a custom 3d-printable torpedo pool toy that I designed using CAD software. 
- The torpedo is powered by the elasticity of a rubber band and can self-propel. 
- By selling these, I raised over $400 dollars for my swim team.
